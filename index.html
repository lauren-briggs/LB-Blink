                    <p>Hello Blink!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We met almost two years ago when I interviewed for an internship with you. Unfortunately for
                        myself
                        and
                        for you, I missed out on the opportunity, but seeing this position as mid-weight designer arise
                        I
                        thought I’d give it another go.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I’m (still) a young and passionate designer, and would like to take a minute to refresh your
                        memory
                        of
                        my qualifications and experience and to let you know what I’ve been up to since we last spoke.
                        Apologies
                        if you’ve heard some of this before.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I first fell in love with design during Vis Comm in year 12 and I’ve been studying and working
                        in
                        the
                        field ever since. After school I studied a Bachelor of Communication Design at Monash. When I
                        graduated,
                        I realised I wanted to keep learning, so in 2019, I completed my Master’s in Visual Design at
                        Scuola
                        Politecnica di Design in Milan, here I was able to meet and work with people from all over the
                        world;
                        this taught me new ways of looking at design problems, and new perspectives to consider.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>At the end of the year, I undertook a three-month internship at Interbrand, where I had the
                        opportunity
                        to work closely with both designers and strategists. This invaluable hands-on experience of
                        seeing
                        and
                        working inside the field completely transformed my understanding of B2B brands. While most of
                        the
                        work
                        was in a team and on large-scale jobs, I also worked on a project one-on-one with the creative
                        director
                        who taught me a great deal about the industry and how a such a large agency runs.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When I returned to Australia, I volunteered as a designer at a non-profit for about a year. As
                        the
                        organisation already had an identity in place, it was a great experience for me to use my skills
                        to
                        develop various creative design solutions within the existing brand guidelines, working on a
                        variety
                        of
                        projects such as reports, EDM’s and content for social media.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In past two years I have completed an online course in User Experience Design through RMIT, as
                        well
                        as a
                        Web Development Bootcamp through Monash. Although I am truly passionate about branding,
                        editorial
                        and
                        publication design, and I love creating a physical, tactile piece of work, I have also always
                        been
                        fascinated with coding and believe that in today’s fast-paced, digital dominated world it is an
                        invaluable skill to have. Hand in hand with this, UX is quickly becoming one of the most
                        important
                        fields of design and I believe that implementing the principles I have learned and facing
                        problems
                        with
                        a UX frame of mind helps to strengthen my work and would make me a great asset to your team.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Since November 2020, I have been working part-time as a graphic designer at Arctic Mirage, a
                        design
                        studio based in Bentleigh. It’s a really fantastic working environment, I am able to work both
                        autonomously and in collaboration with the studio manager. I have been granted a lot of
                        responsibility
                        at the studio, including the rebranding of the studio’s own identity, website and portfolio.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I spoke with Marco after my interview to get some feedback, who told me it was primarly due to
                        the
                        fact
                        that the successful applicant had more branding experience, whereas my portfolio was largely
                        editorial.
                        I hope that my experience from the past two years and the work you can see on my website, will
                        show
                        just
                        how much I have grown as a designer and how I have expanded my range.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        While I do love working at Arctic Mirage, it is a small studio and there is not a lot of
                        opportunity
                        for
                        growth. Because of this, I am eager to find a new role where every day is different and
                        exciting,
                        and
                        where I can utilise and further develop my skills across a diverse range of digital and printed
                        projects. I believe this position would be perfect for me and I hope you do too.
                    </p>

                    <p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
